My notes on how to code faster during Competitive Programming in C++ :

Snippets:
Snippet is a programming term for a small region of re-usable source Code. A lot of modern text editors like Sublime provide you a functionality to automatically write a predefined snippet by just writing a keyword. 
One can speed up their implementation by using Snippets. So if you need to do a BFS or DFS(or any other code), you just need to press ‘Keyword+Tab’ to get it’s code.
Well, how to add a snippet? Adding a snippet in Sublime Text is pretty straightforward. Just navigate to Tools>Developers>New Snippet. 

    <snippet>
    <content><![CDATA[

    // Type your code here

    ]]></content>
    <tabTrigger>ENTER KEYWORD HERE</tabTrigger>
    </snippet>
Use this as your base template for a snippet and paste the code that you want to use in your Snippet by replacing the comment and trigger Keyword.

Macros:
They are a way to assign shorter notations to things that are usually longer to write.
They can be easily written using #define 

For Example: 
Before using Macros:

  long long int a;
  vector<long long int> v;
  map<long long int, long long int> mp;

After using Macros:
  #define ll long long int
  
  ll a;
  vector<ll> v;
  map<ll, ll> mp; 

Using these saves you a ton of time! 
There are many available code snippets available online on various platforms too.
